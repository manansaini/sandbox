 ### What’s most important to you in your career?

“I always strive to be the best at what I do. Although I have the core requirements for the position, and will hit the ground running, I want to work for an organization where I’ll have opportunities to develop my skills, work on interesting projects that will stretch me, and with people, whom I can learn from. Most importantly, I want to work for an organization where I can build a career.”
