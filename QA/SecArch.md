# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

XSS is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

# ISO 27001

ISO 27001 (formally known as ISO/IEC 27001:2005) is a specification for an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and procedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organisation's information risk management processes.

ISO 27001 uses a topdown, risk-based approach and is technology-neutral. The specification defines a six-part planning process:

    Define a security policy.
    Define the scope of the ISMS.
    Conduct a risk assessment.
    Manage identified risks.
    Select control objectives and controls to be implemented.
    Prepare a statement of applicability.

# CoBIT
COBIT  is a framework for developing, implementing, monitoring and improving information technology (IT) governance and management practices.The goal of the framework is to provide a common language for business executives to communicate with each other about goals, objectives and results.

The name COBIT originally stood for "Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology," but the spelled-out version of the name was dropped in favor of the acronym in the fifth iteration of the framework.

COBIT 5 is based on five key principles for governance and management of enterprise IT:

   Principle 1: Meeting Stakeholder Needs
   Principle 2: Covering the Enterprise End-to-End
   Principle 3: Applying a Single, Integrated Framework
   Principle 4: Enabling a Holistic Approach
   Principle 5: Separating Governance From Management
    

# SAML



    Service Provider (Resource Server) - this is the web-server you are trying to access information on.

    Client - this is how the user is interacting with the Resource Server, like a web app being served through a web browser.

    Identity Provider (Authorization Server) - this is the server that owns the user identities and credentials. It's who the user actually authenticates with.

The most common SAML flow is shown below:
