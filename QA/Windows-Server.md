### Explain in windows DNS server what is Primary, Secondary and Stub zone?

In windows DNS server,

1. **Primary Zone:** In this, the file is saved as normal text file with filename (.dns).
    
2. **Secondary Zone:** It maintains a read-only copy of zone database on another DNS server.  Also, it acts as a back-up server to the primary server by providing fault tolerance and load balancing
    
3. **Stub Zone:** It consists of a copy of name server and SOA records which is used for reducing the DNS search orders.

### Explain how you can set up remote installation procedure without giving access to user?

### Explain what does it mean caching only server in terms of DNS?

### Explain what is the way to configure the DHCP server such that it allocates the same IP address to certain devices each time the address is removed?

###  Explain what is LDAP?
