### Network log consolidatioN:  Splunk TOOL

You can collect, store, index, search, correlate, visualize, analyze and report on any machine-generated data to identify and resolve operational and security issues. Turn searches into real-time alerts, reports or dashboards with a few mouse clicks.Index, search and correlate any data for complete insight across your infrastructure.Securely make operational data available without requiring access to production systems.


### NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABILITIES:

When you assess your company’s network infrastructure security, you need to look at the following:

      Where devices, such as a firewall or an IPS, are placed on the network and how they’re configured

      What external attackers see when they perform port scans and how they can exploit vulnerabilities in your network hosts

      Network design, such as Internet connections, remote access capabilities, layered defenses, and placement of hosts on the network

      Interaction of installed security devices, such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), antivirus, and so on

      What protocols are in use

      Commonly attacked ports that are unprotected

      Network host configurations

      Network monitoring and maintenance

If someone exploits a vulnerability in one of the items in the preceding list or anywhere in your network’s security, bad things can happen:

      A hacker can launch a denial of service (DoS) attack, which can take down your Internet connection — or your entire network.

      A malicious employee using a network analyzer can steal confidential information in e-mails and files sent over the network.

      A hacker can set up back-door access into your network.

      A hacker can attack specific hosts by exploiting local vulnerabilities across the network.

      Before assessing your network infrastructure security, remember to do the following:

      Test your systems from the outside in, the inside out, and the inside in (that is, on and between internal network segments and demilitarized zones [DMZs]).

      Obtain permission from partner networks to check for vulnerabilities on their systems that can affect your network’s security, such as open ports, lack of a firewall, or a misconfigured router.

#### Top 8 vulnerabilities inside the network:

1. USB thumb drives:  Believe it or not, USB drives are actually one of, if not the most, common ways you can infect a network from inside a firewall.

2. Laptop and netbooks:  Laptops are discreet, portable, include full operating systems, can operate using an internal battery and come with a handy Ethernet port for tapping directly into a network.
    What to do: Implement an encrypted file system for sensitive data. There are a number of off-the-shelf solutions out there to choose from, along with open source ones such as TrueCrypt.
  
3. Wireless access points: Wireless APs provide immediate connectivity to any user within proximity of the network. Wireless attacks by wardrivers (people in vehicles searching for unsecured Wi-Fi networks) are common and have caused significant damage in the past.
      What to do: WPA2 Enterprise using RADIUS is recommended along with an AP that is capable of performing authentication and enforcing security measures.
      
4. Inside connections:  Internal company employees can also inadvertently or intentionally access areas of the network that they wouldn't or shouldn't otherwise have access to and compromise endpoints using any of the means outlined in this article.Maybe the employee asks a fellow worker for help accessing an area of the network that he doesn't have access to.

  What to do: Passwords should be changed regularly. Authentication and access levels are a must for any employee -- he should only have access to systems, file shares, etc. that are needed to fulfill his duties. Any special requests should always be escalated to a team (not a single user with authority) who can authorize the request.
  
5. The Trojan human:  Like the Trojan horse, the Trojan human comes into a business in some type of disguise. He  could be in business attire or dressed like legitimate repairman (appliance, telecom, HVAC). These types of tricksters have been known to penetrate some pretty secure environments, including server rooms. Through our own social conditioning, we have the tendency to not stop and question an appropriately attired person we don't recognize in our office environment. An employee may not think twice about swiping their access card to allow a uniformed worker into their environment for servicing. It can take less than a minute for an unsupervised person in a server room to infect the network.

   What to do: Reminders should be sent to employees about authorizing third parties. Identify the source by asking questions, not making assumptions.
   
6. Optical media:  In June 2010, an Army intelligence analyst was arrested after being charged with stealing and leaking confidential data to public networks. Sources claim the analyst did so by bringing in music CDs labeled with popular recording artists, using this medium only as a guise. Once he had access to a networked workstation, he would access the classified information he had authorized credentials for and store the data on the "music" CDs in encrypted archives. To help cover his tracks, the analyst would lip sync to the music that was supposedly stored on the CDs while at his workstation. Recordable media that appear to be legitimate can and has been used to piggyback data in and out of networks. And, like the thumb drives mentioned above, they can be used as a source for network infection.

    What to do: As with the USB tip, it's important to implement and enforce asset control and policies around what devices can enter the environment and when. And then follow that up with frequent policy reminders.
    
7. Smartphones and other digital devices
8. E-mail


### Security Assessment Services

#### Network Based (Attack & Penetration):
 
An attack and penetration test will answer questions like:

            How vulnerable is the network, host, and application(s) to attacks from the internet or intranet?
            Can an intruder obtain unauthorized access to critical resources?
            Are social engineering techniques effective?
            Are operational controls effective?

This would involve the ISO acting as an attacker and looking at the system as an outsider.  The ISO would look for:

            Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities
            Patch levels (OS and Apps)
            Unnecessary services
            Weakness of encryption
            Weakness of authentication
            Etc.
#### Host Based
This is an assessment of the health and security of given workstation or server.  Automated scanning tools (e.g. Nessus) are the primary vehicle for this type of assessment.  Additional hands-on inspection may also be necessary to assess conformance to security best practice. 
 
This assessment will answer questions like:.

            Is patching up to date?
            Are unnecessary services running?
            Are anti-virus/anti-malware signatures up to date?
 
This would involve the ISO acting as a Sys Admin and auditing the system and applications looking for:

            Locally exploitable vulnerabilities
            Patch levels (OS and Apps)
            Access rights
            Security best practices
            Etc.

#### Application

This is an assessment of the functionality and resilience of the compiled application to known threats.  This assessment focuses on the compiled and installed elements of the entire system: how the application components are deployed, communicate or otherwise interact with both the user and server environments. 
 
Application scanning tools as well as manual testing with and without application credentials are used to perform this assessment. Typically some host, network, and general information security practices are assessed as part an application vulnerability assessment.
 
This assessment will answer questions like:

            Does the application expose the underlying servers and software to attack
            Can a malicious user access, modify, or destroy data or services within the system
 
This would involve the ISO auditing an application (typically web based) and looking for vulnerabilities like:

            SQL Injection
            Cross Site Scripting
            Cross Site Request Forgery
            Improper data sanitization
            Buffer overflows (limited)
            Mis-configured/weak authentication
            Etc.
 
####  Compliance

This would involve the Information Security Office auditing (or assisting in the coordination of an audit if the ISO is not trained to conduct the specific audit) systems for compliance with specific regulations:

            HIPAA
            FERPA
            GLBA
            PCI
